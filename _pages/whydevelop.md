I believe I can help make your text more coherent, precise, and easier to understand.


## A more coherent text



## Better understanding 



## Precision






## How I work

1. I start by reading through the material. This helps collect the key technical terms and the style
2. I collect big issue questions focusing on audience, expected background knowledge, style and technical terms
3. I go through the material and make changes
4. When finished I often go back to bits adding questions like
	* Do the terms `simple mean` on page 4 and `simple average` on page 8 mean the same? If yes, may be use only one. Authors must decide
	* A variety of terms are used, which may or may not be okay. For example: link, transaction, relationship, contact, linkage -- may or may not refer to the same object, but authors must take a stance and decide.
	* A technical jargon is used in the middle of a section, but never explained. Authors must decide where and how to introduce.
