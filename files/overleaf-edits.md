Our case studies illustrate this approach: each starts with a meaningful question, presents the results of the analysis in an informative way, and, in the end, uses the results +to+ answer the question.

Chapter 17  
When we used a 0.5 threshold, the expected loss jumped to -1.540 vs !0.!-0.588 for the best threshold model.

Let’s say that the couple is fine walking 2 kmiles, and let’s put the distance threshold at 2 kmiles. The ``close" bin contains 157 hotels, with an average distance of 1 kmile (minimum 0.1 kmiles, maximum 1.9 kmiles); the ``far" bin contains 50 hotels, with an average distance of 3.2 kmiles (minimum 2.0 kmiles, maximum 6.6 kmiles).

Chapter 00
For health and sport, we looked at +the+ inner working+s+ of football in the English Premier League, the world's most watched sport league. We first try(ied) to figure out how/who has been the most successful manager in the past decade. Then we look(ed) at the impact of managers, in particular, investigate(d) how a change in the person of manager may affect a team's winning chances. 

Chapter 18  
The second decision +we+-one- always +need+ to consider with time series regressions is whether to include the variables in levels or changes (or relative changes, possibly approximated by log changes).  

+Figure+-Graph-~\ref{ch18_pred_p1} shows the predicted time series for 2017 together with the and actual time series of the price index. +Figure+-Graph-~\ref{ch18_pred_p2} shows the interval prediction (Chapter~\ref{ch13_framepred}, Section~\ref{ch13_sec_kindsofprediction}).   

Chapter 13  
In the end, both methods suggested that we choose M/model 3, which had most, but not all, of the predictor variables in the data, and which didn't have any interactions.  

Chapter 17  
The tree depicted in +Figure+-Graph-~\ref{ch17_treeplot}, is a small tree we built for illustration purposes (with only three variables: firm size (sales), foreign management (Y/N) and if the firm is new (Y/N)).

And, as we discussed in the +Under the hood+ -Also Good To Know- section to Chapter~\ref{Ch04_correlation}, inverse conditional probabilities are not equal in general.  



Chaper 04  
We have also seen that the correlation coefficient is a useful statistic to summarize mean dependence between $y$ and $x$, and it allows usone to dig a little deeper by showing whether and how the correlation differs across groups by a third variable (here industry).

Looking at the time series we see -no- no visible evidence of seasonality.  

However, the trend is not linear, nor exponential, and -there- there is no simple line that would appropriately describe its path. 

Chapter 15   
Then -we- we carry on, and delete one more split at the new terminal level using the same approach, and so on.

Chapter 17  
Let +u+-i-s emphasize again that using the optimal threshold is important. Had we used a 0.5 threshold, the expected loss would have been -1.540 vs. -0.588 for the best threshold model. This is 2.6 times the loss from the optimal threshold.  

Let's assume that the bank lo-o-ses all 10 thousand euros if it extends the loan but the firm exits. This would happen if our classification told the bank that company would not exit but it did  in fact exit: a false negative. The other mistake is having our classification say the company would exit, making the bank deny the loan, when-but- the company stay+ed+-s in business in fact (a false positive). This is a loss because the bank lo-o-ses the profit opportunity, and let's assume that this loss is 1 thousand euros.  

Chapter 18  
Use the transaction-level data from Albuquerq+u+e, New Mexico, U.S.A., that formed the basis of the data we used in the ``Forecasting daily ticket sales for a swimming pool" case study.  

As we can see, when making forecasts for more than on+e+ time period ahead, VAR models use forecasts of both the $y$ and $x$ variables.  

 Finally, we specified model M6, which is same as Model 4, excpepct it has sales in logs.   

Again, the principle is that we want-d- our holdout and test samples to tell us what to expect in the live data forecasting situation. 

Chapter 16  
Thus, a single regression tree built by the CART algorithm is best viewed as an intuitive way to find complicated patterns of association between $y$ and $x$ and use them for prediction, but a single regression tree is rarely -be- the best model to predict $y$.   

Chapter 19  
To focus our attention on middle-age+d+-s- people, we define subjects as people between age 30 and 60.  

Chapter 17  
But +t+his is maximized when its negative is minimized, and its negative is nothing else than $(fn \times relcost + fp)$.  

In this section we show that the optimal threshold found by minimizing expected loss is the same optimal threshold that we wo+u+ld find if, instead, we searched for the maximum of the criterion used by the coords function implemented in R.  

Chapter 08  
That is usually fine +i+-o-f the decision is made based on the value of the $x$ variable.  

Chapter 21  
For example, we may create coa-u-rser industry categories (e.g., by joining food and tobacco, or lumber and furniture). You'll be invited to see whether exact matching with coa-u-rser categories leads to matches for all, or almost all, founder/family owned firms in the data.  

The 95\% CI +is+ -are- [-0.21,-0.17].

In this case, we will have to work hard to get to test our first model. First, we will define the target and discuss the best +way to+ capture the idea of default. Second, we need to design the sample to train our model: +we need to+ filter-ing- out firms that are different to those we care about.
