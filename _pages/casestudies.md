# Previous projects

I have done editing on academic economic papers, economic consulting and data science projects. 

## Corrections to Bekes-Kezdi Data Analysis Textbook by Cambridge University Press (2019-2020)

I have participated in developing the text of an 800-page textbook published by [Cambridge University Press](Bekes-Kezdi: Data Analysis) in February 2021. This meant reading the full manuscript twice. First, in collaboration with the authors, I made some bolder edits on the draft text. Second, I did some copyediting on the revised text. 

Below, I offer details of tasks and examples. 

### Content development

1. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are correct in terms of language but are difficult to understand. Ask authors to clarify.   
2. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are correct in terms of language but need examples. Ask authors to give examples.   
3. Find when authors introduce a new concept without definition or define another concept instead. Ask authors whether the concepts are known to the readers.

### Clarify and improve structure

1. Find repetitive content, paragraphs that may be scattered in a section, but are very close in content. Suggest cuts and edits.   
2. Find unlcear technical terms: authors use various expressions for one concept and it is not clear what they mean.  
3. Identifying paragraphs that are badly structured. Suggest edits, rearrange sentences to make substance clearer.  
4. Suggest adding commas to help non-native students better understand longer sentences.

### Checking numbers,format
1. Look through text and figures to find possible inconsistencies (text and figures, text and tables).  
2. Find references to tables, graphs, earlier sections that do not exist in the text.
3. Find missing labels in figures (x, y axes), missing source, name of case study. 
4. Find inconsistency in format of text. 
5. Find inconsistency in style-we argue instead of one argues.
