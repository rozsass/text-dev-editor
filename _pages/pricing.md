## Shorter projects
For shorter projects, I can either offer an hourly rate, or a fixed price. I calculate the total price as I aim to make $ (incl. taxes) per hour when Iâ€™m editing. 

For a price estimate, I will always ask for a sample of the text as the amount of tasks vary greatly depending on content and style. 

Here are some example:
* A thesis chapter of 30 pages (15,000 words) with data work, tables and graphs, and equations; written in LaTex. This would require going through the text twice and take about 15-25 hours, so the total cost would be around $.
* A presentation in MS Power Point, mostly tables and bulletpoints. This is typically about 3 hours, so about $. 
* A short business report, 10 pages with graphs and tables, written in MS Word. This is typically about 6 hours, so about $. 

## Longer projects
For longer projects, the quote is based on a lower hourly rate, and depends on the nature of the work. 

**In any case, send me a sample of the text, and I'll give a you quote.**
