## The service

I develop academic and business texts making them more precise, coherent, and better to understand for a wider audience.

### Precision



### Coherency



### Better understanding 



## My speciality is 
* academic texts in social sciences especially applied works in economics, politics or international relations, such as
	* textbooks
	* popular texts, reviews, chapters
	* undergraduate and graduate theses
* business texts, such as 
	* consultancy reports
	* market analysis

## Tech skills
I work with 

* your typical word processor, such as MS Word.
* [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com). 
* Markdown using either version control such as Github to track changes or [diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/). [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) is a more recent option, using .md files.  
* presentation platforms in PowerPoint or Beamer (tex) but open to other
