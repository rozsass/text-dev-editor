# Corrections to Bekes-Kezdi (2019-2020)

I have been the *text development editor* for Bekes-Kezdi: Data Analysis textbook, an 800 page volume published by [Cambridge University Press]() in February 2021. This meant reading the full manuscript twice. 

First, making editing on content .....

Second, reviewing the first proof to find errors in ....

Below, I offer details of tasks and examples. 



## Paragraph editing

### Issues
1a. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are okay in terms of language but are difficult to understand / not clear. Ask authors to clarify/ give examples.   
1b. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are clear in terms of language but need examples. Ask authors to give examples.   
2. Identifying paragraphs that are badly structured. Suggest edits, rearrange sentences to make substance clearer.  
3. Find repetitive content, paragraphs that may be scattered in a section, but are very close in content. Suggest cuts and edits.   
4. Find unlcear technical terms: authors use different expressions for a concept and it is not clear if they are the same.  
5. Suggest adding commas to help non-native students better understand longer sentences.  
6. Find when authors introduce a new concept without definition or define another concept instead. Ask authors whether the concepts are known to readers.  
7. There are references to tables, graphs, earlier sections that do not exist in the text.

### Examples
1a. To further generalize the findings to another pattern of interest, such as online-offline price differences among all products in the US sold both online and offline by the same retailers, we would have to assume that the distribution of price differences among the products represented in this data would be very similar in that more general pattern. [page 157](/scans/e1.png)  
1a. Recall that the coefficient on the AR(1) term is estimated to be very strong on the training time series.[page 543](/scans/e1.png)   
1a. All of this is an iterative process.[page 50](/scans/e1.png)   


1b. Understanding what mechanisms may play a role in the effect of the causal variable is important for various reasons.[page 635](/scans/e1.png)   
1b. In observational data we compare observations that may be different in terms of x for many reasons. The data does not necessarily inform us of what would happen to y if we were to change x, because the differences in x are not the result of our manipulations.[page 207](/scans/e1.png)  
1b. Instead it is an imperfect measure because there are differences within some countries, especially within large ones with many groups and areas that have different values and/or institutions.[page 640](/scans/e1.png)      
1b. In fact, some important economic variables are well approximated by a lognormal distribution.[page 216](/scans/e1.png)

 7. This goes on until no improvement oould be made by increasing the fit by at least 0.01.    
This goes on until no improvement could be made that would increase the fit by at least 0.01.[page 430](/scans/e1.png)
8. First, we will define the target and discuss the best +way to+ capture the idea of default. Second, we need to design the sample to train our model: +we need to+ filter-ing- out firms that are different to those we care about. 

5. Taking this to its mathematical extreme **,** as we look at samples that are infinitely large **,** the standard deviation shrinks to zero.[page 140](/scans/e1.png)  

6."non-monotonic slope segments" [page 193](/scans/e1.png)  

7. Regression analysis helps answer each of the questions posed above, and many more...But there are no questions.[page 190](/scans/e1.png)  
7. The following table shows selected exact values for.... But there is no table. [page 235](/scans/e1.png)  

7. This goes on until no improvement oould be made by increasing the fit by at least 0.01.

## Checking numbers and format
1. Look through text and figures to find possible inconsistencies (text and figures, text and tables).  
2. Find missing labels in figures (x, y axes), missing source, name of case study. 
3. Find inconsistency in format of text. 
4. Find inconsitency in style-we argue instead of one argues.   



Gabors letter to Jane in June. 

Read, edit and comment all chapters in latex (overleaf)
Read, edit and comment, check all numbers and arguments in edited case study texts in latex (overleaf)
Create table for exhibits, check match of exhibits in text and table and codes (excel, google docs)

In terms of development editing of the text, the key help was
improve overall quality of text, readability, clarity, 
discuss structural problems in sections, hard to follow arguments, suggest solutions
find repetitive sentences, arguments, suggest solutions
propose change in structural organization, such as change in order of sections or paragraphs
In terms of development editing of the case studies, the key help was

thorough comparison of text, tables and graphs, find errors, mismatch in numbers
find and comment on hard to understand presentation of numbers, discussion of results
help make the introduction and conclusion more practice oriented
