>"Prediction in data analysis means assigning a value to a target variable for a target observation: an observation for which the value of that variable is not known, but other information is known. To do so we make use of the patterns uncovered from existing data to carry out a prediction. The variable to predict is called the target variable or outcome variable. The variables used in the data to help the prediction are called predictor variables. We use data on observations for which we observe both the target variable and the predictor variables to specify a prediction model. The target observations are the ones for which we want to make the prediction. For these we typically observe the predictor variables but not the target variables. We take the model and apply it to the target observations."

So I gave several comments, such as

This was the end result:

> "In data analysis, prediction means assigning a value to y, the target variable, or outcome variable, for a target observation or more target observations. The value of y is not known for the target observations, but the value of one or more x variables is known. Those x variables are called predictor variables in this context. Data analysis with the aim of prediction is called predictive data analysis or predictive analytics.[page 366](/scans/e1.png) "



I will flag repetitive content - paragraphs that may be scattered in a section, but are very close in content. Also, I will find and edit paragraphs that are badly structured, suggesting edits, rearranging sentences to make the substance clearer.  

Many documents I work with are written by non-native English speakers for an audience that is in majority non-native speaker. In these cases,

## My work flow 

1. I start by reading through the material. This helps collect the key technical terms and the style.  
2. I collect big issue questions focusing on the audience and their expected background knowledge.   
3. I go through the material and make changes.
4. When finished I often go back to bits adding questions like
	* Do the terms `simple mean` on page 4 and `simple average` on page 8 mean the same? If yes, may be use only one. Authors must decide
	* A variety of terms are used, which may or may not be correct. For example: link, transaction, relationship, contact, linkage -- may or may not refer to the same object, but authors must take a stance and decide.
	* A technical jargon is used in the middle of a section, but never explained. Authors must decide where and how to introduce. 

Here are some examples:
* A thesis chapter of 30 pages (15,000 words) with data work, tables and graphs, and equations, written in LaTex. This would require going through the text twice and take about 15-25 hours.
* A presentation in MS Power Point, mostly tables and bulletpoints. This is typically about 3 hours 
* A short business report, 10 pages with graphs and tables, written in MS Word. This is typically about 6 hours
