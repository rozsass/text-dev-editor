## How I work

1. I start by reading through the material. This helps collect the key technical terms and the style
2. I collect big issue questions focusing on audience, expected background knowledge, style and technical terms
3. I go through the material and make changes
4. When finished I often go back to bits adding questions
	* Is the term `simple mean` on page 4 and `simple average` on page 8 means the same? If yes, may be use only one. Authors must decide
	* A variety of terms are used, which may or may not be okay. (Example: link, transaction, relationship, contact, linkage -- may or may not refer to the same object. Authors must decide)
	* A term is referenced but never explained. Authors must decide where and how to introduce. 


## Type of edits
1. I ask for clarification on points that are not clear. [Examples]()
2. Suggest unifying terms (example: technology change, tech change, technological change --> technological change)
3. Suggest settling down on a single abbreviation if necessary. (Example )
4. Try to push authors to be more specific. When they say `important`, often it should be noted why or for whom
