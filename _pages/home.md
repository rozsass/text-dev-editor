## The service

I develop academic and business texts and make them more precise, coherent, and easier to understand for a wider audience.   

[Read more](whydevelop) on why you may consider hiring a text development editor. 

## Focus

I focus on editing
* academic texts in social sciences especially applied works in economics, politics or international relations (such as textbooks, popular texts, reviews, undergraduate and graduate theses, solutions to practice questions),  
* business texts (such as consultancy reports and market analysis),  
* presentations.  	

## Tech options
I have learnt to work with a variety of tools used in academia and business such as 
* MS Word with track changes, 
* PDF (annotated),
* [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com),    
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),  
* presentation platforms like MS PowerPoint or LaTex beamer.  

## Language skills

I am *not* a native English speaker. I make some language edits as I go along to help readers, and some stylistic suggestions.  However, if you are not a native English speaker you may need a language editor.  


## Experience and endorsement
