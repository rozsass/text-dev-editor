# Previous projects

I have done editing on academic economics, economic consulting and data science projects. 

## Corrections to Bekes-Kezdi Data Analysis Textbook by Cambridge University Press (2019-2020)

I have been the *text development editor* for Bekes-Kezdi: Data Analysis textbook, an 800 page volume published by [Cambridge University Press]() in February 2021. This meant reading the full manuscript twice. First, I made bolder edits on the draft text. Second, I reviewed the copyedited proof. Despite a great deal of previous edits, there was a lot of additional work. 

Below, I offer details of tasks and examples. 

### Content development

1a. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are okay in terms of language but are difficult to understand / not clear. Ask authors to clarify/ give examples.   
1b. Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are clear in terms of language but need examples. Ask authors to give examples.   
2. Identifying paragraphs that are badly structured. Suggest edits, rearrange sentences to make substance clearer.  
3. Find when authors introduce a new concept without definition or define another concept instead. Ask authors whether the concepts are known to readers.

### Paragraph editing

1. Find repetitive content, paragraphs that may be scattered in a section, but are very close in content. Suggest cuts and edits.   
2. Find unlcear technical terms: authors use different expressions for a concept and it is not clear if they are the same.  
3. Suggest adding commas to help non-native students better understand longer sentences.

### Checking numbers,format
1. Look through text and figures to find possible inconsistencies (text and figures, text and tables).  
2. There are references to tables, graphs, earlier sections that do not exist in the text.
3. Find missing labels in figures (x, y axes), missing source, name of case study. 
4. Find inconsistency in format of text. 
5. Find inconsitency in style-we argue instead of one argues.
