## Content development

**Task: Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are correct in terms of language but are difficult to understand / not clear.**    
**Action: Ask authors to clarify/ give examples.**  

1. To further generalize the findings to another pattern of interest, such as online-offline price differences among all products in the US sold both online and offline by the same retailers, we would have to assume that the distribution of price differences among the products represented in this data would be very similar in that more general pattern. [page 157](/scans/e1.png)  
2. Recall that the coefficient on the AR(1) term is estimated to be very strong on the training time series.[page 543](/scans/e1.png)   
3. All of this is an iterative process.[page 50](/scans/e1.png)   
4. Under lucky circumstances, data analysts may assume that variation in x in observational data that is exogenous, just as if it came from a controlled experiment.[page 580](/scans/e1.png)  
  


## Clarify and improve structure  

**Push for examples, more explanation/Find unlcear technical terms: authors use different expressions for a concept and it is not clear if they are the same.**

1.The bootstrap is a method...The bootstrap procedures....Since the bootstrap distribution is a good approximation.... [page 143](/scans/e1.png)
2....firms with more employees tend to have larger sales. ....we see firms with zero or one employees but with very large revenues...[page 242](/scans/e1.png)   
3....we have two slope coefficients and for the second range, we need to add them up....each line segmnent corresponding to a specific interval of the explanatory variable. [page 223-224](/scans/e1.png)  


**Task: Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are clear in terms of language but need examples.**    
**Action: Ask authors to give examples.**   

1. Understanding what mechanisms may play a role in the effect of the causal variable is important for various reasons.[page 635](/scans/e1.png)   
2. In observational data we compare observations that may be different in terms of x for many reasons. The data does not necessarily inform us of what would happen to y if we were to change x, because the differences in x are not the result of our manipulations.[page 207](/scans/e1.png)  
3. Instead it is an imperfect measure because there are differences within some countries, especially within large ones with many groups and areas that have different values and/or institutions.[page 640](/scans/e1.png)      
4. In fact, some important economic variables are well approximated by a lognormal distribution.[page 216](/scans/e1.png)  
5. Indeed, ARMA models can capture complicated patterns of serial correlation by mixing features of gradual decay with specific values for specific orders of serial correlation.[page 547](/scans/e1.png)  
6. Strong but imperfect correlation between explanatory is sometimes called multicollinearity.  
Strong but imperfect correlation between explanatory variables is called multicollinearity. [page 274](/scans/e1.png)  

7. This goes on until no improvement oould be made by increasing the fit by at least 0.01.    
This goes on until no improvement could be made that would increase the fit by at least 0.01.[page 430](/scans/e1.png)  

8. First, we will define the target and discuss the best +way to+ capture the idea of default. Second, we need to design the sample to train our model: +we need to+ filter-ing- out firms that are different to those we care about. 


## Checking numbers and format

1. For the last bin [3,7] we chose 3.5km not the midpoint, because the distribution of distance is skewed and the median...   
But the figure shows it at 5km.[page 194](/scans/e1.png)  

2. Figures 8.2a and 8.2b show four regression lines.   
But there is only 1 line. [page 221](/scans/e1.png)  

3. x axis shows price in (EUR).   
But the text says USD.    

4. Name of table: House price prediction models.
But the source under the table says swim-transactions dataset.[page 533](/scans/e1.png)  

5. ....it (the model) has all the variables including flags but does not have interactions.  
But the model does not have Financial (1) type variables. [page 519](/scans/e1.png)  

6. z is a mechanism of reverse causality if y affects z, that in turn, affects x.[page 582](/scans/e1.png)  
But there is no z variable in the figure.

7. ...people who eat 100 more grams of fruit and vegetables have lower blood pressure...
But the descriptive table measures fruit and vegetables in numbers not in grams.[page 587](/scans/e1.png) 

8. It produces a model that includes most but not all variables, reducing the number of predictors from 153 to 128.[page 519](/scans/e1.png)
But the table has 134 variables for this model.

9. ...an assumption is called "homoskedasticity". 
Instead of the usually used bold letters, the authors use quotation marks to introduce a definition.[page 266](/scans/e1.png)
