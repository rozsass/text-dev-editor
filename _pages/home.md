## The service

I develop academic and business texts making them more precise, coherent, and better to understand for a wider audience.

[Read more](whydevelop) on why you shall consider hiring a text development editor. 

## Focus

* academic texts in social sciences especially applied works in economics, politics or international relations, such as
	* textbooks
	* popular texts, reviews, chapters
	* undergraduate and graduate theses
	* solutions to practice questions
* business texts, such as 
	* consultancy reports
	* market analysis
* presentations	

## Tech options
I am not a techie. As most text editors I prefer [Mantel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Mantel) to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). But I have learnt to work with a variety of tools used in academia and business. 

* Word processor with track changes, such as MS Word.
* PDF, annotated.
* [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com). Overleaf is a great way to see corrections. Otherwise, diffcheker and similar options are needed. 
* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - like this website is written in markdown for Jekyll. Even [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) could be an option, using .md files.  
* Presentation platforms like MS PowerPoint or LaTex beamer.


## Type of edits
1. Ask for clarification on points that are not clear. 
2. Suggest unifying terms that refer to the same object, and  settling down on a single abbreviation if necessary. 
3. Ask authors to be more specific. When they say `important`, often it should be noted why or for whom.


## Language skills.

I am *not* a native English speaker. I will make some language edits as I go along to help readers, and will make some stylistic suggestions, too. However, if you are not a native English speaker, you may need a language editor.

## Experience and endorsement
