Let me show concrete examples of edits.


## Hard to understand paragraphs

**Task: Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are okay in terms of language but are difficult to understand / not clear. **   
**Action: Ask authors to clarify/ give examples. **  

1. To further generalize the findings to another pattern of interest, such as online-offline price differences among all products in the US sold both online and offline by the same retailers, we would have to assume that the distribution of price differences among the products represented in this data would be very similar in that more general pattern. [page 157](/scans/e1.png)  
2. Recall that the coefficient on the AR(1) term is estimated to be very strong on the training time series.[page 543](/scans/e1.png)   
3. All of this is an iterative process.[page 50](/scans/e1.png)   

## Push for examples, more explanations 

**Task: Identifying paragraphs and sentences that are clear in terms of language but need examples.**    
**Action: Ask authors to give examples.**   


1. Understanding what mechanisms may play a role in the effect of the causal variable is important for various reasons.[page 635](/scans/e1.png)   
2. In observational data we compare observations that may be different in terms of x for many reasons. The data does not necessarily inform us of what would happen to y if we were to change x, because the differences in x are not the result of our manipulations.[page 207](/scans/e1.png)  
3. Instead it is an imperfect measure because there are differences within some countries, especially within large ones with many groups and areas that have different values and/or institutions.[page 640](/scans/e1.png)      
4. In fact, some important economic variables are well approximated by a lognormal distribution.[page 216](/scans/e1.png)
