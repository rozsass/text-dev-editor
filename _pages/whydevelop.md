I believe I can help make your text more coherent, precise, and easier to understand. By using my service, you can expect your material to improve in terms of its content and structure. 


## Increase coherence, improve structure

Text development aims to clarify and improve the structure of the text and create a more coherent content. 
Very often the material includes all the necessary information but some sections and paragraphs are poorly structured. I can help improve the text by pointing out repetition, suggesting restructuring (cuts and edits) to create a better content. 


## Polish for better understanding 

Better understanding is often not about language. As the audience may know less about the material than the author, some discussions and explanations need beefing up. I focus on making sure the content and the main messages are clearly formulated and explained. I check whether the definitions are unambiguous and the technical terms are used consistently. When a point is clear but hard to fathom I suggest adding examples. 


## Check information for a higher precision

Materials in applied social science or business often include a range of numbers and exhibits: tables, graphs, or even maps. An essential aspect of quality is to check the consistency of all the figures throughout the material. To that end, I compare numbers in text and exhibits to make sure they match. I check if graph axes, table headings and footnotes are properly written and displayed, if the same currency is used throughout the text or if graphs are readable at all.   


## A caveat

I am not a language editor, and you may need to have one, too.
