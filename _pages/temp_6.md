>"Prediction in data analysis means assigning a value to a target variable for a target observation: an observation for which the value of that variable is not known, but other information is known. To do so we make use of the patterns uncovered from existing data to carry out a prediction. The variable to predict is called the target variable or outcome variable. The variables used in the data to help the prediction are called predictor variables. We use data on observations for which we observe both the target variable and the predictor variables to specify a prediction model. The target observations are the ones for which we want to make the prediction. For these we typically observe the predictor variables but not the target variables. We take the model and apply it to the target observations."

So I gave several comments, such as

This was the end result:

> "In data analysis, prediction means assigning a value to y, the target variable, or outcome variable, for a target observation or more target observations. The value of y is not known for the target observations, but the value of one or more x variables is known. Those x variables are called predictor variables in this context. Data analysis with the aim of prediction is called predictive data analysis or predictive analytics.[page 366](/scans/e1.png) "
