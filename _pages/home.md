## This textbook
This textbook provides future data analysts with the tools, methods, and skills needed to answer data-focused, real life questions, to choose and apply appropriate methods to answer those questions, and to visualize and interpret results to support better decisions in business, economics, and public policy. Data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, prediction with machine learning, and causal analysis are comprehensively covered, as well as when, why, and how the methods work, and how they relate to each other.

As the most effective way to communicate data analysis, running case studies play a central role in this textbook. Each case starts with an industry relevant question and answers it by using real-world data and applying the tools and methods covered in the textbook. Learning is then consolidated by over 360 practice questions and 110 data exercises. Extensive online resources, including raw and cleaned data and codes for all analysis in Stata, R, and Python are available on this site.

## Why use this book?

**Data analysis is a process**. It starts with formulating a question and collecting appropriate data, or assessing whether the available data can help answer the question. Then comes cleaning and organizing the data, tedious but essential tasks that affect the results of the analysis as much as any other step in the process. Exploratory data analysis gives context to the eventual results and helps deciding the details of the analytical method to be applied. The main analysis consists of choosing and implementing the method to answer the question, with potential robustness checks. Along the way, correct interpretation and effective presentation of the results are crucial. Carefully crafted data visualization help summarize our findings and convey key messages. The final task is to answer the original question, with potential qualifications and directions for future inquiries.

Our textbook **equips future data analysts with the most important tools, methods and skills** they need through **the entire process of data analysis** to answer data focused, real life questions. We cover all the fundamental methods that help along the process of data analysis. The textbook is divided into four parts covering **data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, prediction with machine learning, and causal analysis**. We explain when, why, and how the various methods work, and how they are related to each other. [MORE on content](/chapters)

A cornerstone of this textbook are 47 **case studies** spreading over one-third of our material. This
reflects our view that working through case studies is the best way to learn data analysis. Each of our
case studies starts with a relevant question and answers it in the end, using real life data and applying
the tools and methods covered in the particular chapter. [MORE on case studies](casestudies)

We share **all raw and cleaned data** we use in the case studies. We also share the codes that **clean the data** and **produce all results**, tables, and graphs in **Stata, R, and Python** so students can tinker with our code and compare the solutions in the different software.

This textbook was written to be a **complete course** in data analysis. This textbook could be useful for university students in graduate programs as **core text** in applied statistics and econometrics, quantitative methods, or data analysis. It may also **complement online courses** that teach specific methods to give more context and explanation. Undergraduate courses can also make use of this textbook, even though the workload on students exceeds the typical undergraduate workload. Finally, the textbook can serve as a **handbook for practitioners** to guide them through all steps of real-life data analysis. [MORE on why use this book?](/whythisbook)

## Codes

We provide access to get all the code we used --  in R, Stata and Python.  
  
Public [github repo](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies){:target="_blank"} with pre-release versions available now.    

**Status update:**      
* R -- All codes ready. Used for graphs in textbook.
* Stata -- All codes ready. In the lack of machine learning capabilities, no code for chapters 15,16,17, some limitations for chapter 18.
* Python -- Under preparation. Chapters 01-12 ready, chapters 13-24 are under development. Should be ready by early 2021.

We plan the first release for R and Stata in December 2020, and for Python, we plan an early 2021 first release.
