I believe I can help make your text more coherent, precise, and easier to understand. By using my service, you can expect your material to improve in terms of its content, structure and language. 


## Increase coherence, improve structure

The essence of text development are clarifing text and improving structure to make a more coherent content. 
Very often the material includes all the necessary information, but sections and paragraphs are poorly structured. I can help developing the text: pointing out repetition, suggesting restructuring, cuts and edits to create a better content. 

I will flag repetitive content - paragraphs that may be scattered in a section, but are very close in content. Also, I will find and edit paragraphs that are badly structured, suggesting edits, rearranging sentences to make the substance clearer.  

## Polish for better understanding 

Better understanding is often not about language. Many documents I work with are written by non-native English speakers for an audience that is in majority non-native speaker, too. Thus, I focus on making sure the content and the main messages are clearly formulated, and explained. Often, some discussions and explanations need beefing up, as the audience will know less about the material than the author. I will check if definitions are clear, technical terms are used consistently. When a point is clear but hard to fathom I will suggest adding examples. 


## Check information for a higher precision

A great deal of materials in applied social science or business will include a range of numbers and exhibits: tables, graphs, or even maps. An essential aspect of quality is to check the consistency of all the figures throughout the material. To that end, I will compare numbers in text and exhibits to make sure they match up. I will check if graph axes, table headings and footnotes are properly written and displayed, if the same currency is used throughout the text or if graphs are readable at all.   


## A caveat

I am not a proofreader, and you may need to have one, too.
