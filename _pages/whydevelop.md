I develop academic and business texts making them more precise, coherent, and better to understand for a wider audience.

### Precision



### Coherency



### Better understanding 



## Type of edits
1. I ask for clarification on points that are not clear. [Examples](/text-dev-editor/example-edits)
2. Suggest unifying terms (example: technology change, tech change, technological change --> technological change)
3. Suggest settling down on a single abbreviation if necessary. (Example )
4. Try to push authors to be more specific. When they say `important`, often it should be noted why or for whom
