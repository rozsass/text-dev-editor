### Sarolta Rózsás
I have a BA in Economics and an MA in [International Relations/ European Studies](https://www.uni-corvinus.hu/main-page/programs/ma-msc/?lang=en){:target="_blank"}. For more than a decade, I worked for a small consulting firm, writing reports for US clients on politics and the economy. I participated in two English to Hungarian [translation projects](/text-dev-editor/translations) of economics/econometrics books. In the past two years, I also helped improve the text of a [new data analysis textbook](/text-dev-editor/casestudies).
