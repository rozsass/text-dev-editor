Here is some tip and advice on how to learn coding

# R
There are two toungues in R, called *data.table* and *tidyverse*. We use *tidyverse*.  
There are great many resources, to learn R for data analysis. Here are some ideas:   

1. To learn tidyverse, you may start with the wonderful book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"}.  
+ A wonderful intro, with a focus on starting R and data wrangling, is by Jenny Briant's [Data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R](https://stat545.com/) course, aka STAT545. 
+ U Cincinatti has a very nice guide with discussions on basics, workflow, manipulation in [R Programming Guide](https://uc-r.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.   
+ At CMU, Alexandra Chouldechova has a nice [programming in R materials](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/achoulde/94842/){:target="_blank"}.  
+ A great online course is by Roger Peng, Jeff Leek and Brian Caffo  [R programming onCoursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
+ At Data Carpentry, François Michonneau and Auriel Fournier has a fantastic content --[Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/){:target="_blank"}.  
+ Grant McDermott has a more advanced lecture series with amazing content [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures){:target="_blank"}.   




# Stata
There are many great materials, here is some we like:   
1. UCLA extensive material at [UCLA IDRE Stats](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/modules/){:target="_blank"}. 
2. Amazing two part series by Kurt Schmidheiny [Part 1](https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/stataguide.pdf){:target="_blank"} 
[Part 2](https://www.schmidheiny.name/teaching/stataguide2up.pdf){:target="_blank"}  
3. At Data Carpentry, CEU's Miklós Koren and Arieda Muco are developing a [Stata course for Economist](https://datacarpentry.org/stata-economics/){:target="_blank"}.  
4. Plus, a [Stata cheatsheat](https://geocenter.github.io/StataTraining/portfolio/01_resource/){:target="_blank"}.  

# Python
There are great many resources, to learn R for data analysis. Here are some ideas:   
1.


# Learning a second language
Some people have experience using one language but would now learn a second one. Some ideas we found useful:


## R for Stata users
In Economics and many other social sciences, we use Stata for research, and learnt R or Python as a second language. Here are some links and tutorials we found useful.  
1. Matthieu Gomez has a wonderful intro to [ R for Stata users ](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/index.html){:target="_blank"}  
2. John Ricco has a short intro to [basics of data wrangling](https://johnricco.github.io/2016/06/14/stata-dplyr/){:target="_blank"}  


## R to/from Python
For this textbook, Stata and R code were developed early on, and we started to work on Python code set only after the proof was ready. Some ideas we (and our RAs) found useful
1. [GGplot for Python by Monash ](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/python-workshop-base/modules/plotting_with_ggplot/){:target="_blank"}    
2. [Pandas and tidyverse](link)  


## Python for Stata users
