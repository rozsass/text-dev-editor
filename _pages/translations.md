I participated in two English to Hungarian translation projects of economics/econometrics books.    
In 2004, I was a member of the team that translated G.S. Maddala's "Introduction to Econometrics".  
A year later, I was one of the translators of Barry Eichengreen's book called "Financial crises and what to do about them".
